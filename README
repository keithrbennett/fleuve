---------------------------------------------------------
Solution to the LeanDog Path of Least Resistance problem.
---------------------------------------------------------

I am using Ruby Enterprise Edition:

ruby 1.8.7 (2011-02-18 patchlevel 334) [i686-darwin10.7.3], MBARI 0x6770, Ruby Enterprise Edition 2011.03

...and rspec 2.7.1.

I like JRuby, but for cases like this it doesn't add anything useful
(unless we do this multithreaded, see below) and takes longer to load.

I chose this version of Ruby, and RSpec, because they do the job well.
I haven't worked with Ruby 1.9 much, but if I had, I probably would prefer
to use it for this problem.

I chose the Ruby language because it is a perfect fit for this kind of task --
flexible, concise, expressive.

Much, but not all, of this development was done test first.
I've tested the example inputs to ensure that they produce
the example output (or, in one case, an alternate solution).

There is much optimization that can be done here.  Currently, the
calculation does not stop consuming columns after the maximum
resistance has been reached.  This doesn't make the solution any
less correct, but takes more time to complete.

In addition, for larger data sets, this could be run in JRuby,
with one thread allocated per CPU, and the starting rows partitioned
among the threads.
